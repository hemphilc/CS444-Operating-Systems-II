        This project report is a summary of Homework 4 for Operating Systems II at Oregon State University, Fall 2017. This document includes the approach we used to implement a encrypted block device, a version control log for homework files, a comprehensive team member work log/history, and a report that addresses what we think the main point of this assignment was, how we approached the problem, design decisions relating to our algorithm, how we ensured our solution was correct including testing details, and what we learned from the assignment.

\section{Answer to Each Question }
\subsection{What do you think the main point of this assignment is}
\noindent The main point of this assignment is to learn about SLOB algorithm. We approached the idea of SLOB implementation and tried to understand slob allocator, heaps, and blocks. Also, this assignment allow us to understand paging system within the Linux kernel. We got to practice on writing system calls inside the kernel. \\

\subsection{How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.}
\noindent We took a look at slob.c provided in the mm directory, and read over the lectures on the topic. We simply took the program and modified it. Before implementation, we inspected the program to see how the first-fit and best-fit algorithm worked. \\

\subsection{How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.}
\noindent For testing, we have added system calls for testing the best-fit algorithm implementation in slob.c. We created a test program that allocate memory into buffers prints fragmentation and claimed/free memory.    
\\

\subsection{What did you learn?}
\noindent For this assignment we gained experience working with system call within the kernel as well as finding fragmentation of the pages.
